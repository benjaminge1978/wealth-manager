# Google Analytics 4 Implementation - Test Guide

## Implementation Complete ✅

Your Google Analytics 4 has been successfully implemented with:

- **react-ga4** library for proper React integration
- **Cookie consent integration** - respects user privacy preferences
- **Automatic page tracking** for SPA route changes
- **Environment-based configuration** with measurement ID `G-09PHXWL64K`
- **TypeScript support** throughout

## How to Test Analytics

### 1. Development Testing (Current State)
- Open your browser dev tools (F12)
- Go to the Console tab
- Navigate between pages on your site
- Look for console logs:
  - `"Google Analytics initialized successfully"` (when analytics consent is given)
  - Test mode is enabled in development to prevent live data pollution

### 2. Verify Cookie Consent Integration
1. Clear your browser's localStorage for the site
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see the cookie consent banner
4. **Accept analytics cookies** and check console for initialization messages
5. **Reject analytics cookies** and verify GA doesn't initialize

### 3. Test Route Tracking
- Navigate between different pages (/, /wealth-management, /contact, etc.)
- Page views should be tracked automatically once analytics is initialized

### 4. Real Analytics Testing (Production)
To verify data is reaching Google Analytics:

1. **Real-time Reports**: Go to your GA4 dashboard → Reports → Realtime
2. **Visit your website** (production version) with analytics consent given  
3. **Navigate pages** and verify real-time data appears
4. **Debug View**: Use GA4's DebugView for detailed event inspection

## Available Analytics Functions

You now have access to these analytics functions throughout your app:

```typescript
// In any component
import { useAnalytics, useConversionTracking } from '../hooks/useAnalytics';

const { trackEvent, trackPage } = useAnalytics();
const { trackFormSubmission, trackContactAttempt } = useConversionTracking();

// Track custom events
trackEvent('button_click', { button_name: 'Get Free Consultation' });
trackFormSubmission('contact_form');
trackContactAttempt('email');
```
